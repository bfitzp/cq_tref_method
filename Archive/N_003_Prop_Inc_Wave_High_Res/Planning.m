% We have linked the wavenumber to the number of sample points
%   But do we even need to do that explicitly? For instance, for higher
%   frequencies, convergence will require more poles, which automatically
%   leads to more sample points...
% This work is on hold now. Instead, we will focus on CQ-enabling
%    Trefethen's method directly.
